All close-fitting, flexible clothing is acceptable as long as the line of the body is discernible. This includes clothing such as yoga pants, leggings, and close-fitting t-shirts.
If you will be dancing on a wooden floor, it is recommended that you wear ballet slippers or dance in bare feet. If you will be dancing on a carpet, try wearing textured socks instead of ballet slippers. Ballet slippers can be ordered from several online sources, including Discount Dance Supplies.
